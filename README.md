<h1>AdWings v0.1 | The Barter System of Advertisement</h1>
<p>Created in 2014, AdWings is a barter system of advertisement designed for users who could not afford for advertisement.</p>

<br/>

<h3>The Idea</h3>
<p>Users create account in AdWings and share their hosting space for advertisement and in turn they get to advertise to other user's shared hosting spaces.</p>

<p>Watch this video to see full demonstration of AdWings application: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-EmM0fQXOM">YouTube Link</a>

<br/>

<p>Maybe, I was dumb or the idea, I don't know but I never pushed the idea too hard and lost track.</p>
<p>Please, let me know, if you like the idea or not at <a href="mailto:chettri@live.com">chettri@live</a>.</p>
